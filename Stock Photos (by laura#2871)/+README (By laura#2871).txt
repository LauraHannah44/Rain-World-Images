Do whatever you'd like with them, but any credit or showing me anything big you make with them would be greatly appreciated!
If anyone has any suggestions for stock images I haven't done, feel free to ping me :3
I'm considering extending this work to gifs at some point, but it'd be a hell of a feat to make them transparent too.

to do:
leviathan
leeches
moon
pebbles
angry guardian
lantern mouse glow
things killing slugcat
garbage worms
void worms
void spawn
albinos
pebbles' insides
half eaten food
slugcat movement
rainbows
more scavs and lizards
